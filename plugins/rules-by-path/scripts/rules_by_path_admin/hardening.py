"""The recommended hardening: deny-list the rules directories for Claude's
file tools in `~/.claude/settings.json`, so a rule reaches context only
through the hook and is read or written only through this CLI.

Exactly four entries, for two reasons verified against Claude Code 2.1.233:
only `Read(...)` and `Edit(...)` are consulted (Read governs greps too, Edit
governs every editing tool; a `Grep(...)`/`Write(...)`/`MultiEdit(...)` entry
matches nothing and makes Claude Code warn at startup), and a pattern that
does not begin with `/` or `~/` resolves against the cwd, so the `~/`-anchored
pair is what protects the global rules from inside a project outside $HOME."""
