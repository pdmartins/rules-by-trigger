"""rules-by-trigger-admin — management CLI for the rules-by-trigger plugin.

A rule is one markdown file in `.claude/rules-by-trigger/` that declares its own
glob in frontmatter. There is no index file to keep in sync, so there is
nothing this tool can corrupt on your behalf.

The recommended hardening deny-lists the rules directory for Claude's file
tools; this script is the sanctioned management channel, taking `--root` or
`--global` plus the rule content on stdin and doing all file I/O internally.
Used by the `rules-by-trigger:manage` skill.

Subcommands:
  init                        create the scope directory
  list                        one line per rule: file <- globs
  show   --rule N             print a rule's full content
  which  --path P [--tool T]  which rules cover a path (the hook's own matching)
  add    --glob G [--glob G]  create a rule; markdown body read from stdin
         --type T [--rule N] [--force] [--remember-again-after 30k|25 calls|never]
         [--exclude G] [--tool read|write]  narrow it past its glob
  update --rule N             replace a rule's body (stdin), keeping its globs
  remove --rule N | --glob G  delete a rule file
  move   --rule N --to-global [--anchor any-project|this-project] | --to-root R
                              carry a rule to the other scope, rewriting its globs
  validate                    check every rule: frontmatter, globs, size, safety
  config                      the effective config.json: rule types and defaults
  migrate                     bring a scope up to the current format
  block --list                block: true rules and their native deny equivalents
  block --sync                write those equivalents into a project's settings.json
  status [--path P] [--json]  environment, both scopes, findings, coverage, config
  doctor [--fix|--uninstall]  setup checks, each finding naming its fix
  digest [--sessions N]       harvest sources + the user's turns from recent sessions

Scope: --root <project-root> (project) or --global (~/.claude).
