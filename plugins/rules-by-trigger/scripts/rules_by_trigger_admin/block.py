"""`block`: bridging `block: true` rules to Claude Code's own
`permissions.deny`.

The hook only ever honours `block: true` from the GLOBAL scope (see
`HOOK.blocking_rule` — a project rule is untrusted repository content, and
letting it deny the user's own tool calls would be an escalation). A project
rule that declares `block: true` therefore needs a NATIVE deny entry to
actually block anything: `--list` shows what that entry would be, `--sync`
writes it into the project's own `.claude/settings.json`, reusing the same
merge-don't-duplicate approach `/rules-by-trigger:setup` uses for the user's
`~/.claude/settings.json`.
