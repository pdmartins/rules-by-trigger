"""Executable facade for the rules-by-trigger hook. The implementation lives in
the `rules_by_trigger` package next to this file — see its docstring.

This file stays because four independent things address the hook by this exact
path and must keep working unchanged: `hooks/hooks.json`, the `bin/` launchers,
the admin CLI (which imports it to share the plugin's one glob matcher and one
frontmatter parser) and the test suite. Importing the package here re-exports
that whole surface, so `HOOK.parse_frontmatter` and friends resolve as before.

A hyphen in the name is why this indirection exists at all: `rules-by-trigger` is
not a legal module name, so the package it loads has to be named differently.
