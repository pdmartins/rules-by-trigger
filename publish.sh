# publish.sh — release rules-by-trigger, or just refresh this machine's install.
#
# VERSIONING POLICY. The version is MAJOR.MINOR.REVISION and it changes ONLY on
# a release, i.e. only when develop is merged into main. Between releases the
# version in develop equals the last published one; `0.0.0` means never
# published. There are no `-beta` suffixes: a pre-release suffix would only
# exist to make `claude plugin update` notice a change, and `--local` below
# solves that properly by reinstalling instead of comparing version strings.
# The CHANGELOG follows the same policy: entries are written under
# `## Unreleased` while developing, and a release renames that heading to the
# number it just computed, dated. This script refuses to release an empty one.
#
# WHERE THE LOCAL INSTALL COMES FROM. The mode decides, and the script repoints
# the marketplace accordingly: a release installs from GitHub — exactly what it
# just published, exactly what a user would get — while --local installs from
# this directory, which is the only way to run code that is not released yet.
# The marketplace name never changes, so the install id never changes either and
# the two can never both be installed.
#
# Usage:
#   bash publish.sh --local              refresh this machine's install from the
#                                        working tree. No git, no version change.
#                                        This is what you want during development.
#   bash publish.sh --minor              release: 0.3.1 -> 0.4.0   (default)
#   bash publish.sh --major              release: 0.4.0 -> 1.0.0
#   bash publish.sh --revision           release: 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
#   bash publish.sh --dry-run            print the plan, execute nothing
#   bash publish.sh --yes                skip the confirmation prompt
#   bash publish.sh --keep-local         release without touching the local install
#
# A release merges into main and pushes it. That is not undoable from here, so
# everything that can refuse — branch, clean tree, tests, manifests — refuses
# BEFORE the first push, and nothing after it is allowed to abort the script.
