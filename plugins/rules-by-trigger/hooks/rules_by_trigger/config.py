"""The configuration file: the rule taxonomy and the repeat defaults.

`config.json` is read from three layers, each overriding the one before it:

    <plugin>/config.json                        the shipped default
    ~/.claude/rules-by-trigger/config.json         the user's own
    <project>/.claude/rules-by-trigger/config.json one per project scope, nearest last

`rule_types` is replaced WHOLE by the nearest layer that declares it — merging
two taxonomies by prefix would produce a hybrid nobody wrote. Everything else
merges key by key.

A project layer arrives with a cloned repository, so it is treated as untrusted
input: its numbers are clamped to the floors in `constants.py` and its texts are
bounded, exactly like a glob or a rule body. Nothing here may break injection —
an unreadable or nonsensical layer is warned about and skipped, and the plugin
keeps running on the layer below it.
