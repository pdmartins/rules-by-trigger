"""The text the hook injects around the rules, in every language it ships.

This table is the plugin's property: configuration *selects* a row of it and
can never *supply* one. A config layer arrives with whatever repository is
checked out, and letting it provide the wording of the scaffolding would hand a
cloned repository the pen that writes the sentences the model trusts most —
which is why an unknown language falls back to English instead of reaching for
anything outside this file.

A Python module rather than a data file: no new I/O, no new parser, and no new
untrusted file on the injection path. The English row IS the constant the rest
of the plugin has always used, so selecting `en` emits byte-for-byte what the
plugin emitted before this table existed.

What is deliberately NOT translated is structure, not prose, and stays
byte-identical in every language: the boundary tags and the rule separator
(`neutralize` and every reader locate the block by their exact bytes), the
`[rules-by-path]` marker every SESSION_NOTICE opens with, the `{name!r}` and
`{body}` fields of the deny reason, and the admin command and flags quoted in
the notices — those are commands, not sentences.

`sanitize_language` lives here rather than in `config.py` for two reasons: this
module is what gives a language value its meaning, and `config.py` is already
at the 400-line ceiling this package holds every module to.

    NOT mean 32 characters are too few to word an instruction — they are not —
