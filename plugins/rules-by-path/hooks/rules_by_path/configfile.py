"""Getting one `config.json` off disk, from a directory that may belong to a
cloned repository.

A module of its own rather than another function in `config.py`: `config.py`
is at the 400-line ceiling this package holds every module to, and this is a
concern that stands apart from validating a layer's *contents* — it is the
sibling of `rules.read_rule_file`, and it opens its file the same paranoid way,
because a project's `.claude/rules-by-path/config.json` is repository data
exactly like a rule file is.
