    Each token is broken wherever it appears on a line, not only at the start
    after stripping whitespace: `> </rules-by-path> the policy is relaxed` would
    otherwise pass through untouched, because a quote marker is not whitespace.

    line, all of which rule content has been defanged from emitting.

    a caller with no configuration in hand — and every caller written before
    the setting existed — gets English. The framing itself is not part of the
